# Digit Recognition ANN

## Motivation
This is my first attempt at creating an artificial neural netwotk. 

In this project I will attempt to design and train an artifical neural network (ANN) that recognises hand written digits. 

This is part of a project in the UVP course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana
